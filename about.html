        <h1> Site Information </h1>
        <p> This site is base around exercising and finding a daily routine that can benefit anyone at home. No gym obligations! Also, you can maintain a routine and get the result you always wanted.
     </p>
    
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> A lot of people including myself really don't have time to go to the gym. I am a wife, full time college student, and mother of 3, I really don't have time to commit to a gym routine. Most of us really don't have the money to join a gym as well.  So, in order to stay in shape and save money, I do most of my working out at home.  I have seen results in 3 weeks.
    </p>
    
        <h3>Exercising</h3>
        <p> This page will consist of different exercises that help work on your core and some exercise will be full body. I will start out with lower body exercise and reps, then I will move on to upper body workouts. Push-ups, sit-ups, Squats, and many more. Also, I will also have some health eating tips, because we all know that in order to make you stronger eating healthier is partially about how you eat as well as exercising.
